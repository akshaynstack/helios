# Chat Command

The `chat` command is the primary way to interact with Helios.

---

## Usage

```bash
helios chat
```

Or simply:

```bash
helios
```

Both commands start the interactive chat mode.

---

## Single Command Mode

Pass a prompt directly:

```bash
helios "your request here"
```

Examples:

```bash
helios "analyze this project structure"
```

```bash
helios "fix the TypeScript errors in src/"
```

```bash
helios "create a function to parse JSON files"
```

## Chat Features

### Multi-turn Conversations

Helios maintains context across messages:

```
You: read the package.json
Helios: [reads file and summarizes]

You: what dependencies need updating?
Helios: [analyzes and lists outdated deps]

You: update them all
Helios: [executes npm update]
```

### Tool Execution

The AI automatically uses tools based on your requests:

```
You: show me the git status
Helios: [executes git_status tool]
```

### Streaming Responses

Responses stream in real-time for a natural feel. Toggle with:

```
/stream
```

---

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--model <name>` | Specify model to use |
| `--no-stream` | Disable streaming |
| `--compact` | Enable compact output |

---

## Interactive Commands

During chat, use slash commands:

- `/help` — Show commands
- `/clear` — Clear history
- `/model` — Change model
- `/exit` — Exit chat

See [Slash Commands](/docs/advanced/slash-commands) for full list.
