# Introduction

Welcome to **Helios Engine** — the flow-state AI power tool built for **Vibecoders**. 

Helios isn't just another chat interface; it's a high-performance orchestration engine designed to stay out of your way while providing instant, elite-level context through a suite of Rust-powered tools and proactive automation.

---

## The Vibecoder Philosophy

Helios is designed for developers who value **flow, speed, and intuition**. It eliminates the common friction points of AI assistance:

- **Ultra-Fast Context**: Integrated `ripgrep`, `fd`, and `mgrep` for near-instant search and discovery.
- **Zero Interruption**: Proactive installers set up your environment silently in the background.
- **Transparent Power**: Real-time analytics proving exactly how much manual effort is automated.
- **Unstoppable Logic**: Smart fallbacks for tool-calls and multi-provider model mapping.

## High-Performance Core

### ⚡ Triple-Threat Search
Helios uses the world's fastest search tools to feed context to the AI:
- **Exact Search (Ripgrep)**: Finds any pattern in milliseconds.
- **File Discovery (fd)**: Maps your project structure instantly.
- **Semantic Search (mgrep)**: Finds code by meaning (e.g., "where is the payment logic?").

### 🛡️ Proactive Autopilot
Helios auto-installs its own performance binaries (`rg`, `fd`, `mgrep`, `playwright`) silently. You stay in the flow; Helios handles the setup.

### 📊 Engine Analytics
Every session includes a productivity proof-of-work:
- **Engine Power**: See your optimization status.
- **Context Swaps Avoided**: Know exactly how much manual labor was saved.

### 🛠️ 130+ Power Tools

Helios comes with tools organized in categories:

export const categories = [
  { name: 'File Operations', tools: 'read, write, edit, delete, diff, tree' },
  { name: 'Git Integration', tools: 'status, diff, commit, log, branch, rebase' },
  { name: 'Shell Commands', tools: 'execute, background, script' },
  { name: 'NPM & Package', tools: 'install, run, audit, outdated' },
  { name: 'Cloud & DevOps', tools: 'docker, vercel, railway, fly' },
  { name: 'Utilities', tools: 'uuid, hash, base64, timestamp' },
];

### 🛡️ Supervision Layer

Built-in safety features:

- **Loop Detection** — Stops AI when it repeats actions
- **Security Scanner** — Blocks dangerous code patterns
- **Audit Logging** — All actions saved to `~/.helios/audit.jsonl`
