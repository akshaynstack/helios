## 🔥 Why Helios? (The Vibe-Differentiator)

Most AI CLIs are slow, chatty, and constantly interrupt you with "Would you like to install...?" prompts. **Helios is different.**

### ⚡ 1. The Triple-Threat Search Engine
Helios leverages the world's fastest tools to give the AI instant context:
- **Exact Search (Ripgrep)**: Up to 10x faster than standard tools for finding code.
- **Instant Discovery (fd-find)**: Near-instant file mapping even in massive monorepos.
- **Semantic Search (mgrep)**: Find code by *meaning*, not just keywords. Ask "where is the auth handled?" and Helios finds the vibe.

### 🛡️ 2. Zero-Interruption Proactive Flow
Helios hates wait times. It proactively installs its own high-performance dependencies (`rg`, `fd`, `mgrep`, `playwright`) **silently in the background**. No more blocking prompts—just pure productivity.

### 🌐 3. The Global Browser Grid (Featured ✨)
Helios is the **only AI assistant** that lets you offload heavy browser tasks to a dedicated grid. 
- **Browser-as-a-Service**: Integrated support for **Browserless** via Docker.
- **Live-Vibe Visuals**: Watch the AI browse and debug in real-time on port 9222.
- **Vibe-Audit**: One-click project reports with "Vibe Scoring" and performance metrics.

---

## 🧠 4. The "Engine Power" Analytics
Helios proves its worth. Every session features a persistent analytics footer showing:
- **Tokens Saved**: Real metrics on manual effort avoided.
- **Engine Power**: Optimization % based on advanced tool usage.
- **Cost Avoided**: Estimated USD savings from manual context swapping.

## 🚀 Install

```bash
npm install -g helios-cli
helios config set OPENROUTER_API_KEY sk-or-...
